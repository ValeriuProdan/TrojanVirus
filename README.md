# TrojanVirus
Server and remote-controlled-virus.
This app was developed during a 24 h hackathon in collaboration with 2 of my friends, 
resulting in winning the first prize. The virus can control the victimâ€™s command prompt, 
copy and create files, hide itself in the Task Manager, autorun when the system is turned on. 
The virus also includes a key logger which records everything the client types (including passwords).
